**Motivation**

- Models are only as good as context provided to them 

**What**
- MCP standardizes how AI applications interact with external systems.
    - Prompts
    - Tools
    - Resources

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. 
Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way 
to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
